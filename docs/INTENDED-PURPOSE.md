## Software description

Medicus Suite is a browser extension for Google Chrome that runs alongside the Medicus electronic patient record system (Medicus Health Ltd / Doctolib). It adds a side panel and optional display overlays to the Medicus web interface. It does not install any software on clinical systems, does not write to any patient record, and does not transmit patient data outside the user's browser.

The extension comprises the following functional modules:

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Sentinel** | Displays, against the current patient's record, threshold checks for drug-monitoring intervals and QOF 2025/26 indicator achievement. Passive display only — no clinical recommendation produced. |
| **Slots** | Displays appointment slot availability data already present in the Medicus scheduling system. |
| **Capacity** | Aggregates slot and session data to assist with practice-level capacity visibility. |
| **Triage Lens** | Displays structured triage information for patients in the current consultation queue, drawn from data already present in Medicus. |
| **Submissions** | Displays submission status data for QOF and enhanced services as already recorded in Medicus. |
| **Activity** | Displays aggregated activity data for the current clinical session, drawn from Medicus. |

## Frozen intended-purpose statement

> Software that operates alongside the Medicus electronic patient record to display, reorganise, and summarise data already present in the Medicus system for the patient or session the clinician is actively viewing. The software applies threshold comparisons to drug-monitoring intervals and QOF indicator criteria, and displays whether recorded values fall within those thresholds, using data already visible to the clinician in the source record.

> The software does not generate clinical diagnoses, clinical recommendations, prescribing decisions, or triage decisions. It does not write to, modify, or submit any data to the patient record or to any external system. It does not transmit patient data outside the user's own browser session. It does not replace clinical judgement. All clinical decisions, including verification of displayed values against the source record, remain the sole responsibility of the clinician.

Any use of Medicus Suite outside this stated purpose is at the user's sole risk.

No CE mark, UKCA mark, or other regulatory clearance is claimed.
- It is not clinical decision support software as defined by MHRA, NICE, or equivalent authority.
- It is not endorsed by, affiliated with, or approved by Medicus Health Ltd, NHS England, NHSX, any ICB, any PCN, or any regulatory body.
- It is not a substitute for reading the patient record.
