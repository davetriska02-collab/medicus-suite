## Software description

Medicus Suite is a browser extension for Google Chrome that runs alongside the Medicus electronic patient record system (Medicus Health Ltd / Doctolib). It adds a side panel and optional display overlays to the Medicus web interface. It does not install any software on clinical systems, does not write to any patient record, and does not transmit patient data outside the user's browser. The suite also provides an in-app feedback channel that composes an ordinary email via the user's own mail client; it transmits no patient data and auto-attaches only the suite version, browser, and timestamp.

The extension comprises the following functional modules:

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Monitoring (Sentinel)** | Displays, against the current patient's record, threshold checks for drug-monitoring intervals and QOF 2025/26 indicator achievement. Passive display only — no clinical recommendation produced. |
| **Custom Alert Builder** | Form-based authoring of practice custom rules across five rule types (drug-monitoring, drug-combo, qof-indicator, event-count, composite), with an engine-backed live preview against an editable test patient and schema validation on save. Passive — produces rules the Monitoring module later displays. |
| **Slots** | Displays appointment slot availability data already present in the Medicus scheduling system. |
| **Capacity Forecast** | Aggregates slot and session data to assist with practice-level capacity visibility. |
| **Triage Lens** | In-page overlay displaying structured triage information for patients in the current consultation queue, drawn from data already present in Medicus. On the patient record view it also surfaces deterministic STOPP/START-style prescribing-combination prompts, a risk-tool signpost chip (links to the QRISK3 / QCancer / eFI calculators — computes no score), and NHS Pharmacy First pathway signposting reference snippets — all supplementary prompts to review, not clinical decisions. |
| **Submissions** | Displays submission status counts for QOF and enhanced services as already recorded in Medicus. |
| **Activity** | Displays aggregated activity data for the current clinical session, drawn from Medicus. |
| **Referrals Tracker** | Displays referral audit data drawn from Medicus, including specialty, priority, status, and clinician breakdowns. |
| **Waiting Room / Request Monitor** | Displays live waiting-room patient counts and new-request demand counts with configurable amber/red thresholds. |
| **Patient Record Visualiser** | Analyses a Medicus EPR export PDF locally in the browser to produce a multi-tab clinical dashboard. Outputs include: continuity-of-care indices, investigation trends with clinical zone bands, medication monitoring compliance against NICE/BNF intervals, electronic frailty index (eFI), PINCER-style prescribing safety flags, QOF register review status, and a D3 swim-lane event timeline. No patient data leaves the browser at any stage. |
| **AI Assist** *(optional, off by default)* | Connects to a practice-hosted, **on-premises GP Forge LLM server** for administrative drafting and **verbatim** consultation transcription. Local-network only (no internet egress); outputs are human-reviewed; nothing is written to the record. **Not a medical device.** Off by default — see the dedicated section below and hazard H-036. |

## Frozen intended-purpose statement

> Software that operates alongside the Medicus electronic patient record to display, reorganise, and summarise data already present in the Medicus system for the patient or session the clinician is actively viewing. The software applies threshold comparisons to drug-monitoring intervals and QOF indicator criteria, and displays whether recorded values fall within those thresholds, using data already visible to the clinician in the source record.
>
> The software additionally provides a Patient Record Visualiser that processes a locally-held Medicus EPR export PDF to produce summary analytics including continuity indices, investigation trend charts, a computed electronic frailty index, PINCER-style prescribing safety prompts, and drug monitoring compliance indicators. These outputs are derived from the exported PDF and are supplementary aids to clinical review; they do not replace assessment of the live patient record.
>
> From v3.13.0–v3.14.0 the live side panel additionally surfaces, on the patient record view, deterministic prescribing-combination prompts (STOPP/START-style), a risk-tool signpost chip that hyperlinks to externally-hosted, independently-validated calculators (it computes no score), and NHS Pharmacy First pathway signposting reference snippets. These are supplementary prompts surfaced for the clinician to review and verify; the clinician makes any prescribing-review or signposting decision.
>
> The software does not generate clinical diagnoses, clinical recommendations, prescribing decisions, or triage decisions. It does not write to, modify, or submit any data to the patient record or to any external system. It does not transmit patient data outside the user's own browser session. It does not replace clinical judgement. All clinical decisions, including verification of displayed values against the source record, remain the sole responsibility of the clinician.

Any use of Medicus Suite outside this stated purpose is at the user's sole risk.

> **Proposed amendment (v3.134.0) — pending CSO / DPO / Caldicott sign-off.** The statements above
> (no transmission outside the browser; no runtime AI inference) describe the **core suite**. The
> **optional AI Assist module** below is the single, documented exception. It ships **disabled** and
> is not covered by the frozen statement until this amendment is signed
> (see `docs/CSO-SIGNOFF-gp-forge-ai-assist.md`).

## Optional AI Assist module (v3.133.0–v3.134.0) — off by default

AI Assist is an **optional** side-panel module, **disabled by default**, that connects to a
**practice-hosted, on-premises GP Forge LLM server** (see `docs/INTENDED-PURPOSE-LLM-SERVER.md`).
When a practice explicitly enables it:

- It provides **administrative drafting** (recall/invitation wording, internal admin text) and
  **verbatim speech-to-text transcription** of a consultation. It performs **no generative clinical
  summarisation, diagnosis, triage, prognosis or decision support** — those are out of scope and
  would be a separate, regulated medical-device function.
- It **transmits** the clinician's typed administrative prompt or captured audio to the practice's
  **local GP Forge server only** — on the practice LAN, with **no internet egress** and **no cloud
  or third-party processor**. No patient record is auto-attached.
- Every output (draft or transcript) is returned for **human review and edit**; the module **writes
  nothing to Medicus**. Dictation requires a **patient-informed consent acknowledgement**.
- It is **not a medical device**: it produces administrative text and verbatim transcripts that the
  clinician verifies; it makes no diagnostic, prognostic, triage or treatment claim.

This module is governed by hazard **H-036** and the change-proposal in
`docs/CSO-SIGNOFF-gp-forge-ai-assist.md`, and must not be enabled with real patient activity until
that sign-off (and the deploying practice's own DPIA / DCB0160) is complete.

## What this software is not

- It is not a medical device. The author asserts, on a good-faith reading of MHRA Software as a Medical Device guidance current at the date of this document, that Medicus Suite falls outside the scope of UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (as amended). No CE mark, UKCA mark, or other regulatory clearance is claimed.
- It is not clinical decision support software as defined by MHRA, NICE, or equivalent authority.
- It is not endorsed by, affiliated with, or approved by Medicus Health Ltd, NHS England, NHSX, any ICB, any PCN, or any regulatory body.
- It is not a substitute for reading the patient record.
- The Patient Record Visualiser's eFI score is not a validated clinical frailty assessment tool as used in GP clinical systems; it is an arithmetic approximation based on problem-list text matching.
- The Patient Record Visualiser's PINCER flags are a subset of the full PINCER tool and are supplementary to Medicus's own prescribing safety systems.
- The live Triage Lens STOPP/START prescribing prompts are a small, name-based subset of prescribing-combination checks, supplementary to Medicus's own prescribing-safety systems; absence of a prompt does not indicate prescribing safety.
- The risk-tool chip computes no risk score; it links to externally-hosted, independently-validated calculators.
- The Pharmacy First signposting snippets are reference text and links for the clinician's consideration; eligibility and clinical suitability are confirmed by the clinician, not by the software.
